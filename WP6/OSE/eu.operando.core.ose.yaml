  title: OSP Enforcement (OSE)

  description: |
    
    The OSP enforcement component provides a set of functions that manage the interaction of OSP behaviour with the user's private data. The OSE component is largely in charge of ensuring that an OSP follows both privacy regulations and policies put in place by the user (i.e. in the OPERANDO UPPs). There are a set of events that trigger the usage of this API.
    
    1) When a new G2C OSP registers with OPERANDO via the OPERANDO console. The management console informs the OSE, which then checks that an OSP conforms with existing privacy regulations; if it breaches the regulations, the OSE returns via the management console a report describing the breaches.
    
    2) When a change of OSP privacy policy or of the OSP's privacy settings are detected by the watchdog component. The
    watchdog component sends a message to a privacy analyst who reviews any changes. The privacy analyst may then
    inform the OSE of the new OSP information (to be checked for compliance with regulations and users' UPPs.
    
    3) When a privacy legislation is entered (or changed) via the Regulator API. The OSE checks registered OSPs for compliance with the new regulations; where there is a breach the OSP is notified either by e-mail or the console.

      description: |
        Simple retrieval of an OPERANDO registered OSP's privacy settings.
        This method is called by the watchdog component when it requests the settings last applied by the OSE component.
        
        Pre condition -- An OPERANDO user must have registered with the OPERANDO platform and subscribed to the OSP service in question.
        
        Pre condition --The user's UPP must be stored in the Policy DB component and contain the privacy settings for the OSP service in question.
        
        When the query includes a user id; that user's settings are returned. For a request with no user id as a query parameter, the operation returns the general set of settings covered by this OSP.
